## 🎯 Best Practices

### Sales Strategies

#### 1. Always Suggest Financing for Quotes > $1,000
"I can get you into this for just $X/month. Would that work better for your budget?"

#### 2. Bundle Features for Maximum Value
"If you add the 5-year warranty and delivery, I can get you a better price on installation"

#### 3. Use Rebates as Urgency Drivers
"This manufacturer rebate ends next week - let's lock this in today"

#### 4. Frame Warranties as Protection, Not Cost
"Think of it as insurance - for $50/year you're covered for 5 years"

#### 5. Trade-Ins Overcome Price Objections
"I'll give you $300 for your old unit - that brings your out-of-pocket down significantly"
